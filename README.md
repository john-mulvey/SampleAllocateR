This is a pre-release version of the SampleAllocateR package: designed to optimally allocate samples with known covariates to experimetnal batches.

To install the latest version:
```r
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/john-mulvey/SampleAllocateR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Note that building vignettes is currently very slow, these will distributed pre-built in a future version.
