Description: Allocates a set of pre-selected samples to experimental batches, in a way that seeks to maximise the balance of a specified 
    set of covariates across the batches whilst also allowing blocking of samples if desired. This will allow for downstream batch correction 
    to be performed without confounding with experimentally relevant covariates. We envision the primary use case to be for -omics 
    experiments of a large number of clinical samples, but the methods are broadly applicable to any type of assay or other situations 
    where the value of potentially confounding covaraites are measured for each experimental unit.
