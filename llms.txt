# Installation

This repository contains the **SampleAllocateR** package: a tool
designed to optimally allocate samples with known covariates to
experimental batches.

For more information about the method, please see our [preprint on
bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.21.644523).

A basic [shiny
application](https://m8abun-john-mulvey.shinyapps.io/sample_allocation/)
is available, although for best results please run locally.

To install the latest version:

``` r
# if required, install remotes package
install.packages("remotes")

# install package from github
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/john-mulvey/SampleAllocateR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Note that building vignettes is currently slow, but that it is not
possible to supply them pre-built when installing the pacakge from
github. If you would rather not wait, the vignette can be viewed [on the
package website](https://john-mulvey.github.io/SampleAllocateR/)

# Quick Start Guide

In order to generate a layout with the optimal balance of covariates
between experimental batches:

``` r
optimal_layout_blocked = allocate_samples(toy_data, 
                                 batch_size = 13, 
                                 covariates = c("covariate1", "covariate2", "covariate3"),
                                 blocking_variable = "block_id",
                                 iterations = 1000,
                                 method = "simulated_annealing")
```

The resulting object contains - the original input data supplied, with
the allocated batch appended - results of testing the balance of each
covariate between batches - data for the optimisation process to confirm
that the method has converged, if the method used was the default
“simulated_annealing”

As a simple sanity check, the values of the covariates can be visualised
using the `plot_layout` function:

``` r
plot_layout(optimal_layout_blocked, covariates = c("covariate1", "covariate2", "covariate3"))
```

The allocated layout can be saved to file, for example by:

``` r
write.csv(optimal_layout_blocked[["layout"]], "optimal_layout.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
