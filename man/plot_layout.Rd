\title{Plot the Layout of Samples by Covariate Type}
\usage{
plot_layout(output, id_column = "sample_id", covariates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{A lsit created by \code{allocate_samples()}, containing an item called \code{layout} which is  \code{data.frame} containing the layout information, including sample IDs, batch allocation, and covariates. The \code{batch_allocation} column is expected to indicate the batch each sample is assigned to, and covariates can be of numeric or factor type.}

\item{id_column}{The name of the column in the layout data frame that contains the sample IDs. The default value is "sample_id".}

\item{covariates}{A character vector of covariate names to be visualized. The default value is \code{NULL}, which will visualize all covariates in the layout data frame.}
}
\value{
A named list containing ggplot2 objects. The list may contain up to two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{continuous}: A ggplot2 object showing the distribution of continuous covariates across batches using scatter plots, with each covariate displayed in a separate facet.
\item \code{categorical}: A ggplot2 object showing the distribution of categorical covariates across batches using bar plots, with each covariate displayed in a separate facet and different factor levels shown as different colors.
}
The returned list will only contain elements for covariate types that are present in the data. If no continuous covariates are found, the \code{continuous} element will be absent from the list, and similarly for categorical covariates.
}
\description{
This function generates two types of plots for the given layout: one for continuous covariates and another for categorical covariates. It visualizes how samples are allocated across batches, with separate plots for each covariate.
}
\details{
The function first processes the layout to separate continuous and categorical covariates. For continuous covariates, it creates a scatter plot showing the value of each covariate by batch. For categorical covariates, it aggregates the data to count the number of samples in each category by batch and then creates a bar plot. Both plots are faceted by covariate to provide a clear and comparative view of the distribution across batches.
