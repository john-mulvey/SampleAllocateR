\title{Calculate Effect Sizes Between Covariates and Batch Allocation}
\usage{
calculate_effect_sizes(layout, blocking_variable = "block_id")
}
\arguments{
\item{layout}{Data frame with batch_allocation column}

\item{blocking_variable}{Optional blocking variable to exclude from calculations}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns: covariate, effect_size
}
\description{
Calculate appropriate effect size measures for associations between covariates
and batch allocation. Uses Cramér's V for categorical-categorical, eta (from ANOVA)
for continuous-categorical combinations.
}
\details{
Effect sizes are scaled to be comparable to correlations (0-1 range):
\itemize{
\item Categorical covariates: Uses Cramér's V with corrected formula
\item Continuous covariates: Uses eta (square root of eta-squared from ANOVA)
}

Lower effect sizes indicate better balance (weaker association between
covariate and batch assignment).
